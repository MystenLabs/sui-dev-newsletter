## Development & Ecosystem

### Ecosystem

Enoki is temporarily removing the ability to use Sponsored Transactions Public API Keys on Mainnet. Affected apps will need to update to use backend-enabled Private Keys to publish to mainnet. Mysten Labs hopes to bring back Public Keys in the future. Self-serve publishing (as well as subscription payments) are coming soon; email enoki-support@mystenlabs.com for more information.

### Development Experience on Sui

Now you can call any Sui function from the explorer, including non-entry functions. See the announcement by [@juzybits](https://x.com/juzybits/status/1805581837281947923)
