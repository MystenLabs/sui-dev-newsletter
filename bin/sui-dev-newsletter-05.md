# Welcome to the Sui Developer Newsletter (#4)

_April 15, 2024_

Welcome to the fifth edition of the Sui Developer Newsletter.

We are pleased to announce [Sui Overflow](https://sui.io/overflow), Sui's first global hackathon. Builders and devs from around the world will team up to push the boundaries of innovation on Sui across 8 tracks and compete for over $500k USD in SUI in prizes. Check the website to register for updates and to learn more.

Do you want to showcase your tool, SDK, or other artifact that might be useful for developers building on Sui? We now accept submissions from the community through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-dev-newsletter/). Check out the repository to find more information.

We are eager for your feedback on what you would like to see in the newsletter--tag [@SuiFoundation](https://twitter.com/@SuiFoundation), join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sui) community, or ask on the [developer forums](https://forums.sui.io/).
